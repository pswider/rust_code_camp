# Unleashing the Power of Rust: A Beginner's Guide to Crafting High-Performance Code

[Instructor Introduction](https://www.paulswider.com/)

If you're new to programming or just looking to expand your skills, Rust is a fantastic language to start with. In this session, we'll cover the basics of Rust programming, including its syntax and essential features. We'll also discuss why Rust is such a unique language, thanks to its memory safety and performance optimizations. By the end of this session, you'll have a solid foundation in Rust and be ready to take your first steps in creating your own API or systems-level programming. So, let's dive in and discover the exciting world of Rust programming together!

Please note this repo contains assets for [Boston Code Camp 34](https://www.bostoncodecamp.com/CC34/Sessions), and [TekkiGuru Rust Blog Series](https://tekkigurus.com/). This repo is not designed to learn Rust from beginning to end, but supplement an instructor lead presentation. One of the best places to get started learning Rust as a beginner is [The Rust Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html).

Presentation Slides:

1. Introduction (5 minutes) 
   a)	Welcome and overview of the presentation 
   b)	A brief history of Rust and its growing popularity 

   1.	Origins (2006-2009): Graydon Hoare, a Mozilla employee, started Rust as a personal project to create a safe and concurrent systems programming language, inspired by languages like C++ and Haskell.
   2.	Mozilla Sponsorship (2009): Mozilla began sponsoring the Rust project, recognizing its potential to improve web browser engine development, specifically for the Servo project.
   3.	Rust 0.1 (2012): The first release of Rust, an alpha version, was made available to the public.
   4.	Frequent Iterations (2012-2015): The Rust team made regular updates, refining the language based on user feedback and evolving design goals. Major changes were made to the ownership system, concurrency model, and syntax.
   5.	Rust 1.0 (2015): The first stable release of Rust marked the language's stability and long-term commitment to backward compatibility.

2. c)	Rust's goals: safety, speed, and concurrency 

   d)	[Who should learn Rust?](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html)
