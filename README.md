# Unleashing the Power of Rust: A Beginner's Guide to Crafting High-Performance Code

If you're new to programming or just looking to expand your skills, Rust is a fantastic language to start with. In this session, we'll cover the basics of Rust programming, including its syntax and essential features. We'll also discuss why Rust is such a unique language, thanks to its memory safety and performance optimizations. By the end of this session, you'll have a solid foundation in Rust and be ready to take your first steps in creating your own API or systems-level programming. So, let's dive in and discover the exciting world of Rust programming together!

Please note this repo contains assets for [Boston Code Camp 34](https://www.bostoncodecamp.com/CC34/Sessions), and TekiGuru Rust Blog Series. This repo is not designed to learn Rust from beginning to end, but supplement an instructor lead presentation. One of the best places to get started learning Rust as a beginner is [The Rust Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html).
