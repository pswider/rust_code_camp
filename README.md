### Unleashing the Power of Rust: A Beginner's Guide to Crafting High-Performance Code

If you're new to programming or just looking to expand your skills, Rust is a fantastic language to start with. In this session, we'll cover the basics of Rust programming, including its syntax and essential features. We'll also discuss why Rust is such a unique language, thanks to its memory safety and performance optimizations. By the end of this session, you'll have a solid foundation in Rust and be ready to take your first steps in creating your own API or systems-level programming. So, let's dive in and discover the exciting world of Rust programming together!

Please note this repo contains assets for Boston Code Camp 34, and TekkiGurus Rust Blog Series. This repo is not designed to learn Rust from beginning to end, but supplement an instructor lead presentation. One of the best places to get started learning Rust as a beginner is The Rust Guide.

Presentation:

1. Introduction (5 minutes) 
2. a. Welcome and overview of the presentation 
3. b. A brief history of Rust and its growing popularity 
4. c. Rust's goals: safety, speed, and concurrency 
5. d. Who should learn Rust?
6. Getting Started with Rust (5 minutes) a. Setting up your development environment b. An overview of Rust's syntax and basic data types c. A simple "Hello, World!" program in Rust
7. Rust Fundamentals (10 minutes) a. Variables, constants, and mutability b. Control flow: if, loops, and pattern matching c. Functions and error handling d. Practical example: a basic calculator program
8. Memory Safety and Ownership (10 minutes) a. Understanding Rust's ownership model b. Borrowing, references, and slices c. The benefits of Rust's memory safety guarantees d. Practical example: a safe string manipulation program
9. Concurrency (5 minutes) a. The challenges of concurrent programming in other languages b. Rust's approach to concurrency: fearless concurrency c. Practical example: a simple multi-threaded program
10. The Rust Ecosystem (5 minutes) a. Exploring the Cargo package manager and crates.io b. Popular Rust libraries and frameworks for beginners c. Community support and resources
11. Building a Simple API with Rust (5 minutes) a. Introduction to the Actix-web framework b. Creating a basic API with routing and JSON handling c. Deploying your API to a server
12. Q&A and Closing (5 minutes) a. Answering questions from the audience b. Recap of key takeaways c. Encouragement to explore Rust further and build your own projects

 

Sample Rust API for Power Platform

use std::collections::HashMap;
use azure_sdk_core::prelude::*;
use azure_sdk_dataverse::prelude::*;

use azure_sdk_dataverse::attribute::*;

// Connect to Dataverse using authentication credentials

        "<CLIENT_SECRET>".into(),

    Ok(client)
}

// Retrieve a list of entities in Dataverse
fn get_entities(client: &DataverseClient) -> Result<Vec<Entity>, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let entities = client
        .list_entities()
        .execute()?

    Ok(entities)

// Retrieve a list of attributes for a given entity in Dataverse
fn get_attributes(

        .get_attributes(entity_name.into())
        .execute()?
        .attributes;

    Ok(attributes)
}

// Handler function for the Rust API
fn handle_request(req: Request) -> Result<Response, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    let mut headers = HashMap::new();
    headers.insert("content-type", "application/json");

    let client = connect()?;
    
    let entities = get_entities(&client)?;
    let attributes = get_attributes(&client, "account")?;
    
    let body = json!({
        "entities": entities,
        "attributes": attributes,
    });
    
    let response = Response::builder()
        .status(StatusCode::OK)
        .headers(headers)
        .body(Body::from(serde_json::to_string(&body)?))
        .expect("Failed to build response");
    
    Ok(response)
}
