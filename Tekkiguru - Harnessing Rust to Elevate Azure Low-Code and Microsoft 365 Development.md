# Harnessing Rust to Elevate Azure and Microsoft 365 Development

## Introduction

These are additional resources for part one of a three part series focused on using Rust to build performant and secure Azure, Power Platform and Microsoft 365 applications. Read the full article here on Tekkigurus

## Additional Resources

1. Rust and WebAssembly: https://rustwasm.github.io/docs/book/ This official Rust and WebAssembly book provides an in-depth look into using Rust with WebAssembly for building web applications. It is highly relevant for developers who want to leverage Rust's performance and safety features for web development projects, including those in Power Apps and Microsoft 365.
2. Rust async programming with Tokio: https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial This tutorial focuses on Rust's async programming with the Tokio runtime, which is essential for building highly performant and scalable network applications on Azure. Understanding Rust's concurrency model and async programming capabilities will help developers build responsive and high-performance applications across Power Apps, Microsoft 365, and Azure.
3. Serde: https://serde.rs/ Serde is a framework for serializing and deserializing Rust data structures efficiently and generically. It is crucial for handling data in Rust applications, including those that involve data processing, machine learning, and AI. Serde's capabilities can be beneficial for Microsoft 365 and Azure developers working with large datasets or dealing with data-intensive tasks.
